# ðŸ¤– Supervised Machine Learning â€“ Regression, Classification & Model Evaluation

This repository contains my completed coursework for **Machine Learning Assignment 1**. The focus is on building and evaluating **supervised learning models** from scratch using real-world datasets.

From fitting regression curves to tuning classification algorithms, this project demonstrates my ability to handle **data preprocessing**, apply **core ML algorithms**, and assess model performance with **industry-standard metrics** â€” all implemented in Python using the `scikit-learn`.

##  What I Learned / What I Can Do

âœ… Apply **linear** and **polynomial regression** to numerical data  
âœ… Use **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter optimization  
âœ… Preprocess datasets: handle missing values, normalize, and encode features  
âœ… Train and evaluate classifiers: **Logistic Regression**, **KNN**, **Naive Bayes**  
âœ… Compare models using metrics like **Accuracy**, **F1-score**, **Recall**, **Precision**  
âœ… Use pipelines to ensure clean, modular, and reproducible ML workflows
